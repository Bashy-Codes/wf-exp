## Value Proposition
Nomad Pals is the "Tinder + Reddit + TaskRabbit" for van-lifers. Unlike generic dating apps (where most users aren't nomadic) or general forums (lacking real-time matching), it's purpose-built for the mobile, safety-conscious, practical needs of nomadic life. It solves the core pain points: isolation on the road, difficulty meeting compatible people, and lack of accessible van build expertise.
